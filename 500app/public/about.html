            500Info streamlines stock market decision-making with robust tools and a user-friendly interface. It
            offers news updates,
            predictive analysis, and thorough data examination to assist users at every level of experience.
        </p>
        <p>How does it do this? It's pretty cool. Let's start with how it makes stock predictions.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                It calls a special "library", or a tool published by other developers to add features to code, called
                Yahoo Finance. Yahoo Finance provides
                500Info with tons of stock market data about the S&P 500- about 100 years worth of daily stock prices
                and metrics!
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, 500Info filters this data down to the most recent 20 years and uses some clever statistics to make
                new data from
                the stock market data it already has. It computes whether key stocks
                fell on the previous day, days in a row that a stock has been going up or down, and the proportion of
                the closing price each day over the average closing price over the last 20 years.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then, 500Info uses a Machine Learning model to predict whether the S&P 500 will go up or down the next
                day. It's like a magic 8-ball, but
                with a lot more math and data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, 500Info delivers those predictions to you, the user, in a simple, easy-to-understand format.
            </li>
        </ol>
